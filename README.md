My Approach:
1. Encoding different string based columns to ordinal manner
2. Feature Engineering that worked a little
3. Catboost gave 53.41 max in public, no improvement after that
4. Switched to LGBM, tried subsampling , columns sampling.
5. One hot encoded certain features
6. Got 53.65 on publlic LB, my best private LB is 53.32 but final one is 53.25, hence explaining why i am on 2nd page
